            <h1>about me</h1>
                <p>
                    hi my name is kesh. i don't really know how to tackle an introduction but
                     one of my intended aims for this website is as a sort of portfolio so i will give it my best shot
                </p>
            <h1>work / research</h1>
            <p>
                starting with work. as of the time i am writing this i am a software engineer / bioinformatics scientist at the National Cancer Insitute (NCI).
                specifically within in the Computational Genomics and
                Bioinformatics Branch (CGBB) of the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). certianly a mouthful.
                <br> at work i do research across a number of different cancer types mainly focusing on how we can use medical imaging, in tandem with genomics to 
                <ol>
                    <li>better predict endpoints of interest in cancer</li>
                        <ul>,<li>survival, drug response, recurrance, subtype, ect...</li></ul> 
                    <li>better understand the biology of cancer</li>
                        <ul>,<li>i.e can we generate new hypotheses as to the underlying drivers and mechanisms things like immune response.</li></ul>
                </ol>
                i look at several different types of medical images including MRIs, Whole Slide Images (WSI) and more recently multiplex-immunoflorecent images (miF).
                i have a lot more information about my research, the projects i have worked on / lead, and publications, [under construction here]
