				when asked about my favorite song of all time, lenny by stevie ray vaughan is typically the answer that i give.
				my mom first showed me this song when i was early in high school and getting deeper into my teenage rock phase. 
				i had just started to learn guitar and was obsessed with jimi hendrix.
				<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1Eolhana7nKHYpcYpdVcT5?si=e330190ad49e439a">little wing</a> was always on repeat. this combined with my moms 
				recollections of seeing srv live shortly before his death made for a quick attachment.
