			<hr>
			<p>
				this is a place for me to share random things with my friends and the world. i have some cool ideas but who knows if i can actually make them work. 
				as for right now the site is "under construction"
			</p>

			<p>
				i was inspired to do this by so many talented people in the neocities community.
				some of my favorites are linked [here]. one site in particular deserves special acknowledgement.
				<a href="ribo.zone">ribo.zone</a> is incredible and inspires a lot of this design (including this template). please check them out.
			</p>

			<p>
				i am a bit tired of social media and want to create something that is a bit more
				personal and fun. this is all a work in progress, and far far from perfect but i hope you enjoy :)
			</p>

			<p>
				please enjoy your stay and feel free to contact me with any questions or comments [here]
